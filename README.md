## Summary

Pokemon is an android app that displays scrollable list of names and the respective directory urls for each name. 

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: :)))

## Application Features


The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [ ] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each RecyclerView item

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a UI element for the user to interact with API further
- [ ] Show a `Toast` or `Snackbar` when an item is clicked

## Notes

I wasn't able to complete last week's assignment completely because I simply couldn't fetch data from the APIs. This week I was able to atleast fetch data from Pokemon API and display two texts(name and url) in scrollable format. It was difficult in catching up.
